- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabrielhox - you can also call me Gabe 😉
- 👀 My current obsessions are hovering around:
   * MACHINE LEARNING;
   * CYBERSECURITY;
   * ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATIONS;
   * GUI DEVELOPMENT;
   * BUG BOUNTIES;
   * IoTs;
   * HARDWARE HACKING;
   * GENERATIONAL SIMULATIONS (PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY AND MATH);
   * Among some other crazy stuff... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, not really into it yet, but I am sure I'll get there soon 🤣
- 💞️ Looking for colabs on any of the fields mentioned above, any doubts, reach me!
- 📫 You can send me an email at joaoo@alunos.unicesumar.edu.br -- I'll be sure to reply as soon as I can.
